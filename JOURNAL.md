Asked my friends to look at my PCB, they told me the issues so now I am fixing them, I am like halfway there. I reorganised the keys and the diodes as the keys need to be closer, so here's the latest pic I have

Yes I know I am journaling after a long time that is because I was busy between these days today I tried to complete the case and this is how it turned out. Though I forgot to add space for the display and encoder. I followed the hackpad case tutorial

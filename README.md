# Mechatron

## About

Mechatron is a 65% mechanical keyboard. It has some features listed below:
- An OLED Display [SSD1306]
- A Rotary Encoder [EC11]
- RGB Underglow
- Tactile Switches

## Firmware

The firmware will be KMK which will be written in micropython, as I am using a Raspberry Pi Pico, it makes this easier. Still working on the firmware of the keyboard, for updates check the JOURNAL.md file!
